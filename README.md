This project is to create a basic recipe website , that will display images of a variety of different cuisines, provide a list of ingreadients and step by step instructions to help the clients recreate the dish for themselves. 

  I will showcase the skills i have learnt from the HTML langauge such as , displaying an image on the webpage , creating links to help navigate throughout the website and to suppliers where the ingreadients can be acquired , and displaying text to give a brief discription of the recipes.
